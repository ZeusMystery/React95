# Radio

Yup, just a simple Radio component.

## When To Use

- Used to select a single state from multiple options.
- The difference from Select is that Radio is visible to the user and can facilitate the comparison of choice, which means there shouldn't be too many of them.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Window>
    <WindowContent>
      <Radio value='Pear' label='🍐 Pear' name='fruits' checked />
    </WindowContent>
  </Window>
</Playground>
