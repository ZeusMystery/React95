## Installation

React95 is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react95).

## npm

To install and save your `package.json` dependencies, run:

```sh
// yarn
yarn react95 styled-components

// npm
npm i react95 styled-components
```

In order to have `react95` working properly, you'll also need [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), this way you can use custom themes and get the best of the library ðŸ™‚ _(but that might change in the future)_.
